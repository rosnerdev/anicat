Hey! This is my simple next.js project created using a bunch of different libraries and the Jikan API to be a simple "client" for MyAnimeList.

It's still a work-in-progress, which means that many features are still missing and the code is not the best.

I still have to work on:
- Clean code and best practices
- Authentication(with NextAuth)
- User profiles and lists
- UI improvements
- Anime endpoints(in the site itself using SSR)
- And more...
